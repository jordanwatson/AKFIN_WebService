# Introduction

The role of oceanographic and other environmental or ecosystem parameters on the productivity of the worldâ€™s fish stocks has long been established. Increasingly, such parameters are explicitly incorporated into fisheries stock assessments [@Holsman2016; @Marshall2019], risk assessments [@Gaichas2014]; ecosystem reports [@Ferriss2020; @Ortiz2020; @Siddon2020], or other documents used by the U.S. Regional Fishery Management Councils to guide decision making. Meanwhile, a growing trend in the development of dynamic ocean management tools seeks to incorporate environmental information in near real-time to inform stakeholders for bycatch avoidance [@Hazen2018; @Breece2021], harmful algal blooms [@Harley2020], avoiding interactions with protected species (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/whale_indices/), and more. Thus, as NOAA moves towards a broader adoption of ecosystem-based fisheries management and dynamic ocean management, the accessibility of ecosystem information becomes increasingly critical.

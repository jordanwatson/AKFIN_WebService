# AKFIN WebService 
## Jordan.Watson@noaa.gov & Matt.Callahan@noaa.gov

* Do you have a data query that you do often for the Alaska Region? 

* Would you like to integrate it seamlessly into your code / workflow? 

* AKFIN can create backend database views for many queries (both confidential and non-confidential) and serve those data to you via a customized web service (i.e., a URL).

* This repo demonstrates applications for the currently operational web service (web API) for daily SST data from 1985 - present (updated daily in the AKFIN backend). The data have been clipped to Alaska spatial strata and averaged. See the AKFIN_WebService_ESP_Workshop documents in this repo for details.
